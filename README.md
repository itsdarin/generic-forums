### Plugins ###

Plugins go in `gf-plugins/`.  Plugins should be filed by their plugin name, like `gf-plugins/<plugin name>/...`, unless the plugin adds assets to generic forums; the assets should be placed in `gf-plugins/<plugin name>/assets/{stylesheets,javascripts}/...`.

(note: the formatting logic needs to be moved to lib, with the ability to accept plugins.)
